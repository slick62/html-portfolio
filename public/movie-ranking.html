<h1>My Favorites Flicks</h1>
<h2>The Top Three</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Legend</h3>
<p>Will Smith shows his prowess as an actor, carrying 75% of this movie all alone (well not counting the dog)! The movie never stops, and somehow it comes across as an action adventure, where he is the hero and the victim.</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>Such an amazing love story, with it's twists and turns, taking us through the beginning, middle, and bittersweet end of a relationship spanning decades.
</p>
<h3>Toy Story</h3>
<p>The tale that brings every adult back to the day when they could swear that toy wasn't where they left it! The movie captures the magic of childhood through the eyes of the toys that loved us.</p>
